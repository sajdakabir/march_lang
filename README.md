# March Lang Documentation

## Introduction

March Lang is a simple programming language designed for fun. It provides a basic set of features including variable declaration, arithmetic operations, and print statements.

## Language Features
- **Variables**: Variables can be declared using the keyword `martians`. Once declared, their values cannot be changed.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are supported.
- **Print Statements**: The `launch` keyword is used to print the value of a variable to the console.

## Syntax
### Variable Declaration

martians <variable_name> = <value>;

- `<variable_name>`: Name of the variable.
- `<value>`: Initial value assigned to the variable.

### Arithmetic Operations

<variable_name> = <expression>;

- `<variable_name>`: Name of the variable to store the result.
- `<expression>`: Arithmetic expression involving variables and numeric constants.

### Print Statement

launch(<variable_name>);

- `<variable_name>`: Name of the variable whose value is to be printed.
